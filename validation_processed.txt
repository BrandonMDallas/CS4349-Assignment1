I stayed for four nights while attending a conference . The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St. , but just off the busy streets . The room I had was spacious , and very well-appointed . The staff was friendly , and the fitness center , while not huge , was <UNK> and clean . I 've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago , and this one is my favorite . Internet was n't free , but at $ 10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels , and it worked very well .
we love the location and <UNK> to everything . The staff was very friendly and courteous . They were so nice to our <UNK> year old boy . got his <UNK> full of <UNK> the moment we arrived . We got free wifi and morning drinks by <UNK> up for <UNK> guest program . Ca n't beat that ! the only minor issue is the elevator . we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room . It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often . Otherwise , it was a great stay !
I want to issue a <UNK> to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time : The deal says `` free breakfast '' included in the price . However , what they do n't tell you , is that the breakfast <UNK> of a cup of coffee and a <UNK> ( or two ) ! <UNK> , you need to ask for these `` tickets '' at the lobby when you check in - they wo n't give them to you automatically ! We stayed there over Christmas <UNK> , and we , and I noticed several guests who bought the same package , had a rather unpleasant experience ! The hotel is nice though , if you do n't consider their <UNK> service !
Just got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker . <UNK> up to Chicago for some last minute Christmas shopping . Hotel is in a great location . North end of Michigan Ave. about half a block away . Staff was very nice and professional . Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful . <UNK> this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets . We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room . Good size room , with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed . Bathroom was somewhat small . Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day . Did not eat at the restaurant <UNK> , but saw several people getting <UNK> delivered to the bar . <UNK> comments saying the food was very good . <UNK> service at the <UNK> Bar can be slow . <UNK> run $ 9 and up . Very good drinks and they do n't <UNK> away from the <UNK> . Valet parking was $ 35 a day with <UNK> <UNK> . Overall a great stay . Would definately stay at this hotel in the future .
My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July , <UNK> . We had ( 3 ) 1 bedroom suites . Great Location in downtown Chicago . Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions . The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly . The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded . I recommend going early . The rooms were quiet and clean . I highly recommend this hotel for families and for <UNK> staying <UNK> <UNK> days . We would stay here again . Parking is expensive , about $ <UNK> . It is valet . The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $ <UNK> so we did valet parking . The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly . This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites ( 3 different cities ) . I have had a great experience each time .
i <UNK> my <UNK> and it was returned with a <UNK> side mirror . They <UNK> it was their fault , and now they wo n't pay the $ 500 to fix it because we ca n't <UNK> it was not broken before ! ! ! the hotel is wonderful , the rooms are new and nice , but we will never stay here again because of this ... <UNK> sure to <UNK> your car before you leave !
great expectations from the hotel of THE <UNK> ! <UNK> lobby ! AND <UNK> <UNK> IT ! The room was old in style and <UNK> , the tv was from the other century , no minibar , no wireless internet , no wireless <UNK> enough for the number of the room , those guys <UNK> that we are in the <UNK> of <UNK> without cable <UNK> . small room , small bathroom , rude service room . they have lost my credit card number and want <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for a breakfast of 20 dollars . <UNK> in the business center , <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> for internet connection , you have to pay to use word , or <UNK> . NEVER AGAIN !
<UNK> my price on priceline . $ <UNK> <UNK> . Hotel room was great . <UNK> , <UNK> and new . Fresh <UNK> sheets , comfortable bed , flat screen TV , clean carpet , nice bath , etc . <UNK> distance to food and sightseeing . I highly recommend this property . Be prepared to pay over $ <UNK> per night to park . <UNK> , Its a <UNK> . They also charge $ <UNK> for a bottle of water that is normally a <UNK> . For a total of $ <UNK> <UNK> stay in Chicago this place is it just do n't drink the bottled water . <UNK> <UNK>
I never write these reviews , but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the # 1 <UNK> <UNK> choice . <UNK> Service , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> of <UNK> , allow <UNK> to <UNK> all morning after multiple complaints , <UNK> charges to room , front <UNK> at checkout and checkin were <UNK> . The <UNK> on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to <UNK> his <UNK> through with his <UNK> son , and the doorman watched on doing nothing . Me and my girlfriend are young , look young in how we <UNK> , but in all <UNK> make more money than most ... and we were treated like cheap poor kids . I had dinner reservations at <UNK> and wanted to order a car to pick us up , the concierge <UNK> that , `` You know its not jeans and running shoes right <UNK> . <UNK> ? '' <UNK> I was too <UNK> to <UNK> that a 5 star $ <UNK> <UNK> wont allow <UNK> shoes because I am young ? Very <UNK> . Very nice looking , comfortable beds , great room service , contemporary , younger crowd , but service was terrible .
My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as <UNK> . What a beautiful hotel ! Our room was lovely , the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient . They do n't have an in house gym , but each day you can get a day pass to a <UNK> gym down the street . The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast . The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there . We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel , as well as through the Gold Coast and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . There are tons of great restaurants in the area ( including the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> Room in the Hancock tower ) as well as lots of shopping . There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott ( they are building <UNK> right behind it ) , but <UNK> we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago .
This is my second time here in two months ; both stays were great . The rooms are very nice and very clean . The staff is terrific and always attentive . My only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk .
If I did n't have to stay here , I would n't . <UNK> <UNK> , I <UNK> I am not lying , every day of my stay <UNK> a new problem . Over the past 3 months , I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time ; problems every time . From the wrong food with room service , to room keys that dont work , <UNK> bath towels , forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service , <UNK> ice bucket overnight , forgotten room cleaning , <UNK> to <UNK> to the Internet ... .I 'm too tired to keep <UNK> all the problems . For the price of this <UNK> downtown hotel , I expect more . Finally , their <UNK> is certainly not <UNK> in customer service . The front desk <UNK> have <UNK> , and Aria 's <UNK> think they are something else . I 'm stuck using this hotel since it is <UNK> to <UNK> , but I would never go back if I had a choice . The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding .
Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago . We decided to stay at the Talbott , and we reserved a room there over a month ago . I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful , but the accommodations to be quite disappointing . We were given room # <UNK> . Avoid this room at all costs ! The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you <UNK> most of the night ( and then <UNK> you at 6 AM ) . In addition , we had requested a king bed , and # <UNK> has two doubles . We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room . Despite the very friendly staff and its super location , the Talbott was less than what we expected , and we would probably not stay there again .
I believe I can not <UNK> how amazing was our stay at The James . Service was <UNK> , from the door man to the front desk . Location could not be better . Yes , you can hear the <UNK> in the street from the 14th floor , but , come on , you are downtown , what do you expect ... <UNK> noise was not in a level to bother us . The only minor incident was a <UNK> that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm ... PM not AM ? Go figure ...
My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad , not really <UNK> it 's location . We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave. ( It 's <UNK> to <UNK> right in the heart of downtown . ) Great for shopping . The hotel itself was fabulous . The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants . I recommend going to Joe 's that 's right across the street from the hotel . Everyone was <UNK> about it . . .but we could n't get a reservation . The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable . It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere . My husband loved the workout room . I highly recommend the Conrad ! !
If you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you 're willing to pay a little extra , I 'd recommend this <UNK> , pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are <UNK> short walk to Michigan Avenue . Excellent service from the <UNK> , concierge , lobby <UNK> , and <UNK> in the restaurants . The food in the restaurants was great and room service was n't too shabby <UNK> worth the money !
<UNK> architecture is only the beginning of what can only be <UNK> as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life . The attention to <UNK> in the room and the bathroom is <UNK> and the bed is the best night 's sleep I 've ever experienced in a hotel . <UNK> <UNK> tv and <UNK> <UNK> machine added to my <UNK> . Sofitel is worth the extra $ 's .
We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights , a wonderful <UNK> was on the 29th floor , absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking <UNK> perfect and service really <UNK> were always <UNK> 's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop , but in front of the hotel there are buses ( <UNK> ) waiting there next turn , not a real bus stop , but <UNK> are <UNK> and you can get on the <UNK> time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel .
For a supposed 4-star hotel , I was not very impressed at <UNK> . The lobby was nice and <UNK> , but there were no <UNK> outside to help with bags or open the doors ( we did n't arrive that late at night ) . Additionally , when we walked into the hotel late one night , there was <UNK> and flowers <UNK> on the lobby floor and , it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in . <UNK> was the staff to clean up ? That 's not a very welcoming <UNK> . The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view , but the actual location was <UNK> than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue , <UNK> it was also a little too far south . Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night !
My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor , there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights , beat up and old <UNK> style . It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed . Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two <UNK> . All night there are <UNK> that make noise , that are supposed to be <UNK> or relaxing and rather they are just annoying . There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you , I paid for the wifi , and still we were unable to get on . <UNK> , my sister and I split the bill , I had already paid for the first night in form of a <UNK> and they gave her the credit . Room cost with city taxes etc . was <UNK> a night . I know the <UNK> Inn just a few blocks away is <UNK> cheaper ! So while the View was wonderful , it is NOT worth the money .
This was our third trip to Chicago this year ( we <UNK> the city ! ) - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel . Swissotel was definitely our favourite . When we come back in July to see the <UNK> `` Wicked '' for the second time , we will be again at Swissotel . No more need to try other hotels ! The location is good because it is between the <UNK> district and the Magnificent Mile . The room was spotless and quiet , the view amazing and those elevators were so fast . Comfortable beds , friendly service , not as many noisy <UNK> ! We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed ! This was the best anniversary ever . We would recommend Swissotel to everyone !
We stayed here because of all the great reviews , and it 's all true . We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything , everyone , and the location . Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer . <UNK> 's <UNK> and the Hancock building to name a couple . This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago . It should also have more than three stars . I mean three stars is for the hilton <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , and this place far <UNK> chain hotels like those . <UNK> on the room you get , any price under $ <UNK> would be a good deal . <UNK> <UNK> - 300 could still be worth it .
After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo , I decided to give this hotel a try . I must say it was a great choice ! The location is perfect , just off from <UNK> Michigan Ave , walking distance from everything . The staff was very helpful and friendly , and the room was excellent . They gave us a corner room <UNK> great view . As many have posted , the bed & pillows were very comfortable ( I am very picky about that ) . I slept well every night ! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit . I highly recommend this hotel .
I stayed here for business and loved it . Got it for $ <UNK> <UNK> tax on Priceline , an incredible deal for this hotel . If I was n't on priceline I would expect to pay $ 200 per night ( maybe more ) for this <UNK> of service . It 's in the heart of downtown Chicago , <UNK> to many locations . The lobby is very impressive , the room was very nice . No complaints at all , from check-in to check-out . I was alone so did n't go to the bar but it looked like people were really <UNK> themselves . It was full of people all the time . I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city .
<UNK> they took $ <UNK> off my card , even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night . They had no business taking the money off of my card . So on the <UNK> <UNK> I contacted them and they <UNK> to the mistake . It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back . <UNK> I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel . When I looked a week later , they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate , so two of my friends did n't come to the trip away . <UNK> I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken <UNK> as the dollar was weak <UNK> the <UNK> . After about 8 phone calls over 5 months ( each saying they would ) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional <UNK> . Overall , the hotel was nice and in a nice location , but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems .
<UNK> appointed , <UNK> staffed , comfortable , <UNK> , and elegant , with wireless internet access ( plus free access in an <UNK> on the second floor ) , fitness center ( a little small but fine if you use it at the right time ) , good <UNK> clientele , easy access to Michigan Avenue , next door to <UNK> restaurant , 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks , elevators that are there before you get your <UNK> off the <UNK> - they thought of everything . Will definitely return !
My daughter and I were in Chicago for one night after having attended a <UNK> conference elsewhere in <UNK> . We were only in Chicago on our way home . We did n't know where to stay in Chicago , but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their <UNK> in the Chicago <UNK> <UNK> . We 're glad we did ! We enjoyed our stay very much . Our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city . That 's what we wanted -- a great view , and we got it . Also , the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop ( we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it was n't bad -- <UNK> us a lot of money ) . The elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available . We found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating . The only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago . We wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night . We would definitely stay there again .
We live down the block from the hotel . We arranged to have new floors put in our <UNK> while we were away . The floors were not <UNK> when we returned so we looked for an <UNK> local hotel for one night . I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there . Over the years I had had some visiting <UNK> stay there . I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself . The lobby is elegant . The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated . The location is the best <UNK> area in the city ( as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away ) and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ( a good shopping street ) and reasonably convenient to the Loop ( the main business area ) There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price <UNK> in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city . I paid less than $ 100 including tax for one night . I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around .
I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip . The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great . I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny , but ours was perfectly fine , with funky , fun doors . The decor is a lot of fun . We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise . The front desk staff was very friendly , and before we even made it to the desk , a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within <UNK> of our arrival . We were within walking distance to all the <UNK> and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier . For people who were upset about no free coffee - there 's a <UNK> <UNK> about a block away . I definitely recommend this hotel !
Great , awesome service . <UNK> , the people are amazing . That , and the nice bartender who serves after last call ( at least , that 's what I was told - I of course do n't drink ) save this place from one star . But seriously <UNK> , small , <UNK> rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $ <UNK> , even in a major city , the rooms better be awesome . I 've had <UNK> better rooms in <UNK> for $ <UNK> . ( Good thing I had a corporate rate . ) And my room was not especially big , despite what the below reviews say . But here 's the main problem . Even on the <UNK> floor , the guy blowing the <UNK> to <UNK> cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 , and <UNK> , and <UNK> , and <UNK> , and <UNK> , and <UNK> , and ... and , well , I finally got up and said <UNK> it , let 's <UNK> the day . Maybe everyone else was already up , but somehow I <UNK> it . <UNK> now <UNK> <UNK> in the Four Seasons .
I stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and <UNK> it ! The staff are great , the rooms are spacious and clean , and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. Plus if you sign up for Omni <UNK> <UNK> ( for free ) you get free wireless internet access .
Beautiful historic hotel -- and since I 'm in historic building business , was looking forward to stay . <UNK> rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite , they <UNK> me to a room that was completely torn up -- <UNK> work torn <UNK> in bathroom , <UNK> fixtures literally falling off wall , mirror torn off wall , etc . <UNK> up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer , but <UNK> waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions . Only two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators <UNK> floors , so you can be stuck waiting for ever . When I <UNK> this to hotel staff , was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it . <UNK> , no . This is not an old building problem , this is a <UNK> elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it . <UNK> way down , stay away . Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if you 're looking for old world charm , <UNK> <UNK> .
My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference . We stayed in a spacious suite . All amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape . The bed was very comfortable . <UNK> were great . I love their products in the bathroom and used them in the <UNK> tub two out of three nights . The room was so quiet , it was very relaxing . We ate in the restaurant downstairs ( Aria ) and although pricey , it was excellent . The staff were <UNK> attentive and <UNK> . It is <UNK> that everyone is very <UNK> . I would love to stay here again .
I arrived at the Sofitel for a <UNK> leisure and business . It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very <UNK> . The rooms are spacious , great beds , pillows and linen . The bathroom has a great shower and bath . WiFi works really well and the desk is large . The staff are wonderful . The location is great for shopping , spa 's , Starbucks and <UNK> . I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it .
The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap <UNK> . The carpet was exceptionally worn , wallpaper peeling , bathroom grout dingy . The place felt like it had n't been <UNK> in 30 years . On top of that , the windows would not open ( not <UNK> for a <UNK> hotel ) , and there was no air fan for <UNK> or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work , I have no idea ( they said <UNK> <UNK> ' whatever that is ) , but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air <UNK> . We even went so far as to <UNK> the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel <UNK> . So much for <UNK> . I ca n't comment on the food , because we ate out at every chance . Chicago has some fantastic food ! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel . The hotel is in a good location , near the waterfront and <UNK> park , shopping and dining . The conference facilities were average , but frustrating because they were in the <UNK> and cell phone reception was <UNK> . I will never stay in this hotel again , especially for the price , because of the poor room quality .
I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago , an older hotel with a great <UNK> ( a bit <UNK> design , but still very lovely and charming ) , clean rooms , and very friendly staff . They 're also amazingly <UNK> - they welcomed our <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a gift bag ( <UNK> and directions to an <UNK> area ) , and even had a cute <UNK> with visiting dog 's <UNK> on it .
October 3rd , 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 . The hotel is VERY modern . The room was immaculate , but the <UNK> looked as though it came from <UNK> . It was chipped in many places . The light <UNK> were difficult to find , and the HVAC made noise . However , the bed was wonderful . The bathroom was large and well maintained . Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted . The restaurant was small . You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called <UNK> . If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel . However , after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel . <UNK> to checking in we had paid for everything in full . When we checked in , we were asked to leave a credit card for <UNK> . Upon returning home , we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it . This reduced the line of credit , and it took several days to be removed from the card . Great location ! <UNK> value . If you have a <UNK> <UNK> they allow you to check out at <UNK> as <UNK> to 12 in the afternoon .
My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in March , 2006 . We had a great time ! We were upgraded to a suite , and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with <UNK> . <UNK> , <UNK> print robes , and a luxurious <UNK> sized bed ! <UNK> suite was very nice , and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street . It was very <UNK> , and the lobby was lovely . We enjoyed the <UNK> wine hour . The staff was attentive , and our stay in this Kimpton hotel made our <UNK> trip to Chicago <UNK> ! We would return here !
My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great . The check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question , and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while . The rooms were well decorated and spacious , although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door . The bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late . I would definitely stay here again !
This was a great place to be ! Great views of river and lake , walk to everything , a clean and comfortable room , and very accommodating staff . We arrived early and were checked in by <UNK> am and checked out late , <UNK> <UNK> two days to our vacation . It is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers .
Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel . Enjoyed the free <UNK> wine happy hour , and the <UNK> were quite nice ( our beds were very soft and comfortable ) . We had excellent views of the river from our rooms . The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town , with easy access to public transportation nearby . My friends actually received the goldfish upon request , which they enjoyed . Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above , but it was <UNK> . <UNK> seemed very <UNK> to us for the location . Will certainly return to the <UNK> City and plan on staying here again .
<UNK> beyond the rock theme and it 's an average hotel with a good location . Room was <UNK> hot and the controls on the wall did nothing . Thank goodness the window opened or we 'd have been <UNK> <UNK> . That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave . This <UNK> with our neighbors door <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> door <UNK> every 30 <UNK> made for a <UNK> <UNK> . Room was stuffy too . <UNK> <UNK> on carpet lead me to believe nasty <UNK> had <UNK> room on many occasions . <UNK> happy w/ Aveda in bath . <UNK> bar was good with great service and well made drinks <UNK> pricey .
In my experience the Ambassador hotel did n't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment . The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated . The <UNK> was very old and worn . The floor - <UNK> and <UNK> both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable . I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel . <UNK> , it 's <UNK> need of renovation .
We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends <UNK> . The room was clean and new feeling , nice city view , free bottled water in room upon arrival . Check in was a breeze , and our room was ready even though we were several hours early . All staff was friendly and helpful , excellent breakfast .
While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before , this was my husband 's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time . Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful . The warm <UNK> in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing . Unfortunately we missed the wine hour . One thing that <UNK> impressed me is that <UNK> of flight <UNK> we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager <UNK> the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a <UNK> reservation .
This hotel is rather <UNK> to be <UNK> . It 's a horrible <UNK> to be <UNK> but <UNK> up looking similar to that Saturday <UNK> live <UNK> where things are so <UNK> that they are not <UNK> . The rooms are about the size of a <UNK> box and there is n't much in them . I actually like the <UNK> in the bathroom but there is no sink . I had to put my <UNK> on using the <UNK> for <UNK> . It also took me <UNK> to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything . I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone <UNK> <UNK> the bathroom doors are n't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan ! It was just over the top for me and lots of <UNK> nearby to keep you up at night . On a good note , the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean . That 's about the only good thing I can say about this place . I would not go back .
I expected a <UNK> room and I walked into a disappointment . Housekeeping and <UNK> must not be concerned with attention to <UNK> at this hotel . If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms does n't go down past <UNK> , the closet is 24 '' wide , all <UNK> <UNK> fixtures , beds that are a little bigger than a twin , <UNK> that barely put out water , then this is your hotel . I might be <UNK> by staying in Marriott 's , but I stay in hotels 1/3 of the year and was <UNK> <UNK> . No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again .
After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day , I left the hotel , <UNK> the street and started to walk <UNK> on <UNK> while looking for a cab . I was still within <UNK> of a Sofitel doorman when I <UNK> a cab <UNK> one block away and attempted to <UNK> same . After doing so , I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his <UNK> . As the cab <UNK> to pick me up , the doorman continued to <UNK> at me and <UNK> his <UNK> as he started to run in my <UNK> . When the cab stopped , I quickly entered cab and locked the door for <UNK> of being physically <UNK> by the Sofitel doorman . After <UNK> the door , the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to <UNK> me from outside of the cab . After <UNK> that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs , he suggested that I had no right to <UNK> a cab in the <UNK> of the hotel and then called me a `` <UNK> '' before <UNK> the cab <UNK> to <UNK> to my destination . <UNK> , unless you enjoy being <UNK> by hotel doormen , please do n't <UNK> to <UNK> a cab anywhere near the hotel under any <UNK> without first <UNK> the <UNK> of a doorman . <UNK> , as for the rest of my stay , you will enjoy this hotel if you <UNK> a highly <UNK> staff who prefer to speak to guests in <UNK> instead of <UNK> . While I have nothing <UNK> the <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> , I much prefer <UNK> in <UNK> when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world . <UNK> la USA !
My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in <UNK> so we got a discount . The <UNK> were really friendly , you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel . Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants <UNK> the hotel at street level . That also made finding the hotel <UNK> because I expected a <UNK> to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street . The lady at the front desk was friendly and <UNK> . Our room was very clean . The fact that it is an <UNK> stay hotel was nice when it came to <UNK> home <UNK> from restaurants , <UNK> and <UNK> food . The complimentary breakfast was great ! They have real food such as <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> toast , <UNK> , bagels , juice , milk , and <UNK> . The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a <UNK> that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue . They also have free WiFi . Overall , I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others .
my husband and <UNK> stayed here after a very <UNK> week in new <UNK> . The room was very spacious and clean , the bed was huge and extremely comfortable . I really liked the Aveda bathroom products , great smell . We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and <UNK> hot . <UNK> to the <UNK> . The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy <UNK> , directions were given to us <UNK> by a <UNK> . The weekend we were there it was their <UNK> air and <UNK> show , this was spectacular . The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy <UNK> and the Millenium park . Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping . If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here .
The only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other Kimpton hotels . It was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee . The robes were not in the room and it took a long time ( hours ) but other than that a great place . The concierge was excellent .
Arrived at <UNK> only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the <UNK> club connected to the hotel . If you party and stay out all night anyway , this hotel would be fine . But do n't plan to get any rest if the club is open ! Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in . She was fine with me and gave me a corner room , but sure would n't want to be on her bad side .
Check <UNK> went <UNK> . But be <UNK> ... . <UNK> are super thin , the building is old and the rooms are very very very small . The downside of them <UNK> <UNK> was that we could hear the poor dog <UNK> in the morning probably because it needed to go out . For the price it was n't bad . It was walking distance to most major attractions . Overall ... it 's ok at best . Another plus is the CTA is close by .
We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a <UNK> Suite but <UNK> a wide hallway with a window at one end . Bad cheap furniture , carpet that stops short of <UNK> the wall , a TV that <UNK> out into the middle of the room and a window that <UNK> when the <UNK> blew . <UNK> <UNK> experience . <UNK> <UNK> hotel plenty in the area .
This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete . The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at <UNK> and goes on into the night . <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> also seems to go on <UNK> . <UNK> of all , the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the <UNK> go <UNK> from the construction next door to street to <UNK> . <UNK> !
I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance , yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise . I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day . The next morning , prior to being moved to a quiet room , the toilet in my original room <UNK> <UNK> a large <UNK> <UNK> . About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street . The room was quiet but smaller and <UNK> . The mattresses in each room were very <UNK> , I would even say hard . I asked if any <UNK> mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same . At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of <UNK> that <UNK> from the card the room was reserved under , and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes , which seemed longer because the <UNK> to the airport was waiting right outside , with other <UNK> . ( The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later . ) As <UNK> for the noise , <UNK> , <UNK> , the hotel offered exactly nothing . Not a great stay .
The Good <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad <UNK> curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The <UNK> Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud <UNK> from the elevator kept us up . I am a <UNK> sleeper but even with my white noise <UNK> <UNK> on the hotel 's iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up . Also our toilet leaked into a <UNK> by the shower . The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately . Also , they mentioned that they had <UNK> been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers .
On our visit to Chicago , we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown , within walking distance to most major attractions , such as <UNK> Tower , Magnificent Mile , <UNK> <UNK> , etc . <UNK> & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . Overall the hotel was very nice , clean , and at a great location . Was in a safe area . <UNK> to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both <UNK> <UNK> . I love Chicago and would <UNK> stay here again !
We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New <UNK> 's in <UNK> just to get away for a few days . We found it through web deals and got a <UNK> suite very cheap . So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again . It also included parking at the great price . Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago . Best location to walk <UNK> . My 12 and 11 <UNK> <UNK> loved swimming at night and the chocolate <UNK> on their pillows . Ca n't wait to go back .
<UNK> from the location , great , but it stops there . Upon check-in , I was informed I would have a queen bed . I asked for a king size bed , and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king . <UNK> <UNK> A <UNK> , a <UNK> for going from a queen to a king . When I got up to the room , it was like a oven . I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service . Everything in the room had a charge <UNK> to it , even down to the coffee , $ <UNK> . Now what 's up with that ? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom . Very small . I have stayed there twice and with so many other options , I feel this will be my last .
I just enjoyed a <UNK> weekend at the Swissotel Chicago . A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate . <UNK> than even a <UNK> <UNK> . So keep an eye out for <UNK> . The view was great , the location was <UNK> . The staff was helpful . The room was large ( we had 2 double beds ) . I only have one complaint . Our room was next to some sort of storage or <UNK> room where employees ( I think ) would <UNK> off to talk on the phone . The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them <UNK> . <UNK> , the sound was only in the bathroom so it was n't like it kept us up at night . It was just a little weird . Overall , a great stay and I will definitely stay there again .
I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a <UNK> not to drive all the way from <UNK> suburbs to <UNK> 's hospital <UNK> my <UNK> . <UNK> things I really did n't enjoy - I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from <UNK> <UNK> noise <UNK> at all ! Very dusty between window <UNK> ( I understand - <UNK> , <UNK> ) but it looked like it was n't cleaned for a very long <UNK> more thing really made me upset - broken <UNK> on a right side . I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time ... We did n't notice the problem until <UNK> <UNK> Affinia hotel serving <UNK> and guests of Chicago as well as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and their families - which really need extra <UNK> and comfort ! <UNK> but every hotel I stayed @ was <UNK> with the <UNK> roll of toilet <UNK> did n't even offer <UNK> like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady ! <UNK> toilet paper nor toilet seat were <UNK> for us to use ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Hopefully , no more <UNK> for me ... <UNK> n't stay @ this place for leisure - even with discount !
Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly <UNK> my expectations . I had no idea it would be so large , so nice and with so many amenities . I also did n't <UNK> that it is just around the corner from <UNK> Park and the Art Institute . We were met at the door by the <UNK> staff . Even with a long line at check-in , the entire process was about 10 minutes . We enjoyed the room with the <UNK> TV , decent size bathroom and comfortable bed . Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious <UNK> lunch at the main restaurant . Paid $ <UNK> through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago . We have stayed at the <UNK> which is much more upscale , but we also paid over $ <UNK> there .
I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok . The main <UNK> are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center , which is truly annoying . In addition , there are so many rooms you often have to walk a <UNK> years to find your room once you get off the elevator . Other than that , it is a classic old hotel with some <UNK> charm . But , the room they gave me most recently was so small it was <UNK> . The door to the bathroom could not open as it <UNK> the desk , and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it <UNK> the bed . There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed , so they <UNK> it off to the side . Room <UNK> makes <UNK> <UNK> seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this <UNK> . It should not be sold as a hotel room .
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white <UNK> . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were <UNK> the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ... . never heard back .
My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad , unfortunately , we would never stay in this hotel again . The rooms looked nice , but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . The room service cost was super high - <UNK> us over $ 100 for 1 burger , 1 order of <UNK> toast , 2 <UNK> and 2 <UNK> . In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud <UNK> noise which kept us <UNK> . We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ( we were on the 5th floor , same as the reception desk ) . They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . The staff was friendly enough , but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . There was not even a coffee <UNK> in the room . Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . NOT worth it !
Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting . The hotel has some <UNK> in the lobby , meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating . I would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch . My car was <UNK> during valet parking , our reservations were messed up , hotel staff showed up <UNK> throughout the week at our door with items ( room service , a new coffee <UNK> , <UNK> ) that was n't ours . I would not stay at this property again . There are much better places for the money in close <UNK> to Michigan Ave . It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at <UNK> Towers .
If you love <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , then this view is for you . I asked for a room facing the river , I get a room facing a <UNK> <UNK> . That really <UNK> me off . From all the great reviews , I was expecting better . Before I came here , I stayed in a Hyatt in <UNK> , and that was awesome . There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away . The wine hour was ok . I was hoping there would be something better food , but I guess that 's why it 's a wine hour . I ordered room service one night . There was n't really anywhere to eat it , so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv . This was my first time coming to Chicago , and I think it will be my last . Just thoroughly disappointed .
Booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful <UNK> , and was rather disappointed . Bed was either the world 's smallest queen , or was actually a double , not to mention it was uncomfortably <UNK> . Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used ( <UNK> ) . Lots of noise seemed to carry through the <UNK> as we could hear other rooms rather clearly . When the tv was off , there was a very <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> noise that we could not get <UNK> of unless we <UNK> the tv . <UNK> water was very inconsistent in the shower . It is in a great location , however , next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott . This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business , but I would n't recommend it for a romantic night or two .
Stayed there three nights from <UNK> through <UNK> . <UNK> in about <UNK> AM . Had to wait about 15 minutes because of <UNK> requests I had made . Room was quiet , and comfortable . <UNK> <UNK> over last time I stayed there ( about 5 years ago ) . The renovations were great , and maintained the old time charm of the hotel .
